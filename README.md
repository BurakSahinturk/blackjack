# blackjack

This is the third of my learning JS challanges. It's a simple blackjack game in Turkish scripted by following <a href="https://github.com/perborgen">Per Herald Borgen</a>'s <a target="_blank" href="https://scrimba.com/learn/learnjavascript">tutorial</a> on <a target="_blank" href="https://scrimba.com/">Scrimba.com</a>.

But I'm improving the project further than the original tutorial.
<br>
List of my improvements:
<ul>
  <li>Sorted the deck with suits and picks the card from a complete set of a shuffled card deck</li>
  <li>Adopted the Ace cards so they can be either valued as both 1 and 11 as needed</li>
  <li>Stores the player name in local storage</li>
  <li>Ability to change the pot and keep a score of your chips</li>
  <li>Keep a score of your highest chip records, tied to the player name</li>
  <li>Added an introduction page</li>
  <li>Modded the pot so it cannot be changed after the game starts</li>
  <li>Made sure the pot can't be a nagative number</li>
  </ul
  <ul> Changes in the Fourth Commit:
  <li>Cards are shown with images</li>
  <li>Code fixes</li>
</ul>
