This is a BlackJack game in Turkish.
I have followed <a href="https://github.com/perborgen">Per Herald Borgen</a>'s <a target="_blank" href="https://scrimba.com/learn/learnjavascript">tutorial</a> on <a target="_blank" href="https://scrimba.com/">Scrimba.com</a> and made a simpler version of this BlackJack Game. After getting some Object Oriented Programming tutorials I decided to rework this app. I have to thank Per, as he is a perfect tutor helping me get all this way up so far. I kept his graphic design but the coding has been completely reworked following Object Oriented Programming principles. Here's a list of other improvements made on the basic tutorial:

<ul>
  <li>Sorted the deck with suits and picks the card from a complete set of a shuffled card deck</li>
  <li>Adopted the Ace cards so they can be either valued as both 1 and 11 as needed</li>
  <li>Ability to change the pot and keep a score of your chips</li>
  <li>Modded the pot so it cannot be changed after the game starts</li>
  <li>Made sure the pot can't be a nagative number</li>
  <li>Cards are shown with images</li>
